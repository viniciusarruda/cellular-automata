# Cellular Automata

## Directory structure

```
|- one_dimensional.c: Simple code that prints a one-dimensional cellular automaton based on a input rule and the number of generations.
|- generate_output_grid.c: Code to generate a file with a grid, and you have to modify it by replacing the dashes with zeros  where you want. The dash is a dead cell and zero, is an alive cell. This file will be the first generation of Game of Life and will be given as input to the program below.
|- two_dimensional.c: Simple code to a program that receives as input a file with the start grid and the dimension of a grid. Note: To work , the dimension given to the program above have to be the same that this program.
|- README.md: This readme file.
```

**Note: This code is outdated. Was made when I started programming (:**
